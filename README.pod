=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BundleInspector - Gather prereq and config info from PluginBundles

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ; in dist.ini
  [Bootstrap::lib]
  [BundleInspector]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is useful when using L<Dist::Zilla> to release
a plugin bundle for L<Dist::Zilla> or L<Pod::Weaver>
(others could be supported in the future).

Each bundle inspected will be loaded to gather the plugin specs.
B<Note> that this means you will probably want to use
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib>
in order to inspect the included bundle
(rather than an older, installed version).

This plugin does L<Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource>
and the bundle's plugin specs will be used
to determine additional prereqs for the dist.

Additionally this plugin does L<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger>
so that if you include a line in the pod of your plugin bundle
of exactly C<=bundle_ini_string> it will be replaced with
a verbatim block of the roughly equivalent INI config for the bundle.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 bundle

Specify the name of a bundle to inspect.
Can be used multiple times.

If none are specified the plugin will attempt to discover
any included bundles.
